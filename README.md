Zenodo Archive https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18370328

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete design files and engineering documentation for a 55-coil drum-style electromechanical test platform. The system is designed as an educational tool to rigorously investigate control strategies for pulsed magnetic interaction, specifically exploring the angle-timed impulse ("timed push") mechanical oscillator concept (evaluated experimentally).

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a standardized, reproducible hardware platform for researchers to:
1. Study the effects of precise pulse timing on rotor momentum.
2. Evaluate the efficiency of series-aiding bifilar coil geometries.
3. Perform honest, measurement-based energy accounting (input versus harvest).

**Disclaimer:** This project is strictly educational. No claims are made regarding net-energy gain or sustained operation. Any conclusions drawn from this hardware must be based on verifiable metrology.

## Contents
