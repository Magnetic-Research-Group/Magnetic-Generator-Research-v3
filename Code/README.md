# Control Firmware (Placeholder)

This directory is intentionally reserved for future reference firmware related to:

- Timing control and pulse scheduling
- Hall sensor and encoder interfacing
- Data logging and measurement support
- Experimental control strategies for the magnetic generator test platform

## No Firmware in This Release

No control software is included in this release.

All timing strategies, pulse widths, sequencing logic, and optimization methods are deliberately **unspecified** to allow independent researchers to:

- Implement their own control approaches
- Avoid bias introduced by a single reference algorithm
- Perform independent verification and comparison

## Future Releases

Any firmware published here in the future will be:

- Clearly labeled as **experimental reference code**
- Accompanied by measurement context and limitations
- Explicitly non-optimized
- Released without performance, efficiency, or self-sustainment claims

This separation between hardware disclosure and control logic is intentional and aligns with best practices for open, reproducible experimental research.
